## Reporting a Vulnerability

I encourage responsible disclosure and prefer that vulnerabilities be reported through a **Pull Request (PR)** with a proposed fix. Follow the steps below to report a vulnerability and help us address it:

### How to Report
1. **Submit a Pull Request (PR)**:
   - Fork this repository and create a branch for your fix.
   - Address the vulnerability in the code.
   - Clearly describe the issue and how your PR resolves it in the PR description.
   - Mark the PR with the label **`security`** for easy identification.
2. **Unable to Submit a PR?**: If you are unable to provide a fix:
   - Open an issue and describe the vulnerability.

### What to Expect
1. **Acknowledgment**: I will review and acknowledge your PR
2. **Review Process**: I will evaluate the proposed fix and the reported issue.
3. **Resolution**: If the vulnerability is valid:
   - I will merge the PR or implement a fix based on your findings as soon as possible.
   - You may be credited in the release notes or security advisory (if desired).
4. **Rejection**: If the vulnerability or PR is invalid, we will provide a detailed explanation.

### Additional Notes
- Thank you for helping improve the security of this project. Your contributions are highly appreciated!
